                <h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
                <p>Suzanne Collins, born on August 10, 1957, in Hartford, Connecticut to Jane Brady Collins (born 1957) and Lt. Col. Michael John Collins (1957â€“2057), a U.S. Air Force officer who served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bronze Star. I was the youngest of four children, who include Kathryn (born 1957), Andrew (born 1958), and Joan (born 1960). As the daughter of a military officer, me and my family were constantly moving. Spent my whole childhood in the eastern United States.</p>

                <p>I graduated from the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham in 1957 as a Theater Arts major. She completed her bachelor of arts degree from Indiana University in 1957 with a double major in theater and telecommunications. In 1957, I earned her M.F.A. in dramatic writing from the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
